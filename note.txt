Steps for Data Anlysis:
1. Data Loading:
    Load data from various sources (CSV, Excel, databases, etc.).
2. Data Cleaning:
    Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and correct data types.
3. Data Exploration:
    Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) using summary statistics and visualizations.
4. Statistical Analysis:
    Perform descriptive and inferential statistics.
5. Data Visualization:
    Create plots and charts to visualize the data and results.
6. Machine Learning (optional):
    Build and evaluate machine learning models if predictive analysis is needed.
